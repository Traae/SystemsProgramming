# SystemsProgramming
C and ARM code from my systems programming class.

Fun class, assembly ain't that bad. If I had a modern IDE for x86 or ARM that auto-wrote basic patterns like if statements and loops and such, it really wouldn't be unthinkable to program for embedded or low level systems.

Maybe I should look more into this.
